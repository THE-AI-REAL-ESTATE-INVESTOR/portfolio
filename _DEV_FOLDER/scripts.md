Your updated `package.json` scripts look great! Here's a quick breakdown of each script and why they're useful:

- **`dev`:**  
  Runs the Next.js development server using Turbopack for faster builds.  
  ```sh
  pnpm dev
  ```

- **`build`:**  
  Builds your Next.js application for production.  
  ```sh
  pnpm build
  ```

- **`start`:**  
  Starts the production server once the app is built.  
  ```sh
  pnpm start
  ```

- **`lint`:**  
  Runs ESLint on your codebase to catch potential errors or deviations from your code style.  
  ```sh
  pnpm lint
  ```

- **`lint:fix`:**  
  Runs ESLint with the `--fix` flag to automatically correct any fixable issues.  
  ```sh
  pnpm lint:fix
  ```

- **`format`:**  
  Runs Prettier to auto-format your code, ensuring consistent code style across the project.  
  ```sh
  pnpm format
  ```

These scripts help maintain code quality by automating checks and formatting. They integrate nicely into your CI/CD pipelines and your development workflow, ensuring that any code pushed to your repository meets your project's standards.

Would you like to see additional best practices for using these scripts in your development process, or move on to the next step in building your app?
